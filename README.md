## A simple reaction tester that times how fast your reactions are. Reactometer displays your reaction time as a score from 1 to 10. Uses the smallest chip in the PIC family - the 10F200 - a device with only 4 I/O pins.

## How To Use Reactometer

Reactometer tests how fast your reactions are and displays your reaction time as a score from 1 to 10.

When you connect the battery Reactometer first demonstrates the scoring system it uses. Ten different patterns of light represent scores from 1 to 10. The highest score is all the lights on.

To begin the test, press and release the pushbutton. This starts a pattern of running lights. The lights freeze after a random period of time. Press the button as fast as you can when this happens.

Your reactions are timed and displayed as a score from 1 to 10. The higher the score the faster your reactions are.

If you cheat by pressing the button too early then you lose. Similarly if you press the button too late you also lose. Both cases are shown by all the lights flashing.

Press the pushbutton again to restart the test.
